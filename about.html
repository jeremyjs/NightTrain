				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<p><b>
					Purdue Night Train was started in 2000 to create an awesome community of swing dancers at Purdue University.  We are one of the largest organizations at Purdue  and welcome everyone to dance with us no matter what your experience level is.
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Night Train is a social dance organization, meaning that we do not participate in dance competitions as a club, although some of our members participate individually.
				</p>
				<p>
					We encourage our members to come to our weekly dances to get their minds off of school, work, exams, jobs, or anything else that might cause them stress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our organization welcomes purdue students, faculty, staff, and members of the community. We strive to spread the joy of swing dancing to everyone, so bring your friends!

						<h4>KALINA</h4>
						Dance has been my life for as long as I can remember, but when I started swing dancing about 5 years ago, I fell in love. I started teaching for Purdue Night Train 3 years ago. This is my fourth time teaching level one and I still love it! I have traveled all over the country dancing a variety of styles. I have dabbled in charleston, east coast swing, balboa, and west coast swing, but my main dances are lindy-hop and blues. I bring my passion for this dance to my teaching in hopes that every student leaves feeling like they can be confident dancers who just love to swing-out!

						<h4>DEREK</h4>
						I am a Purdue graduate that has been dancing here with Purdue Night Train for over four years. While I have experimented with many different types of dancing, my roots lie in Lindy Hop and Blues dancing; dances I learned right here at Purdue. Dancing is an obvious passion for me and it shows through in my mannerisms and attitude when teaching, dancing, or even talking about dance. I have been teaching and DJing for the club off and on for the past three years and am looking forward to passing on the swing bug to a brand new class of dancers. When asked about what has kept me dancing for so long, I said "I cannot resist the connection you get when you meet another dancer and your styles and technique match up perfectly. The fact that you can have such an intimate and fantastic connection with someone that you have only just met is a testament that swing dancing is not only a dance, but a language of its own. That occasional connection is more than enough to keep me coming back to the dance floor week after week."

						<h4>KAYLA</h4>
						I was introduced to swing dancing in 2009 and was instantly hooked. Since then I have attended several workshops and exchanges all over the midwest. I have taught both Level 1 and Charleston at Purdue. I want my students to have a good time, but also I want them to be challenged and leave each class feeling like they have grown as dancers.

						I have been dancing since 2011 when I became a nerd in swing dancing. I'm highly influenced by Thomas Blacharz who is famous for his unique style of free form body movement and intricate musicality. While big complicated movement make a dance look cool, simple musical movement is what actually inspired my dancing. Having traveled to varies swing events around the US helps to improve my dancing a lot, and I am glad that I have the chance to share my experience with everyone.
