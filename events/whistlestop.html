          <p>

          <h4><a href="http://www.falty.com/index.html">Michael Faltesek</a></h4>
          <p>
            Falty brings to the dance floor an incredibly diverse social and performance dance talent that includes not only Lindy Hop but also Cakewalk, Black Bottom, Traditional Jazz, Tap, Charleston, Breakaway, Balboa, Big Apple, Blues and many other Authentic American Jazz dances.  So basically swing dancing.
            <br><br>
            Falty has been dancing for well over 15 years, in that time he has traveled to instruct, compete, and perform all over the globe, from Harlem to Los Angeles, Canada to Korea, and all throughout Europe. Falty is well known for his charismatic personality, approach-ability and passion for the essence of authentic jazz dance and music.  He possesses an enthusiastic ability to convey ideas and movements explicitly, making him a popular instructor wherever he goes. He has taught hundreds of workshops here and abroad, each time leaving a lasting impression on his students.
            <br><br>
            Falty's main sources of inspiration are the greats of yesteryear. Dancers and performers like Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, the Nicholas Brothers, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, John Bubbles, Earl "Snakehips" Tucker, and the Berry Brothers.
            <br><br>
            Falty's main dance partner is considered the most trusted face in Lindy Hop, Casey Schneider.  However, he has the fortunate opportunity to teach with some of the world's best instructors including the likes of Nina Gilkenson, Ramona Staffeld, Carla Heiney, Laura Glaess, and even the swing dance goddess herself, Sylvia Sykes.

          <h4><a href="http://caseyschneider.com/about/">Casey Schneider</a></h4>
          <p>
            Casey Schneider is a lindy hop and vintage jazz dancer, teacher, performer, and choreographer.
            <br><br>
            Casey’s love of swing and jazz dance and music began in 1998. Today, she brings her experience to students both locally and nationally. Casey is known for her clear teaching style and approachability. Her students develop solid technique while appreciating the playful side of the dance. She also encourages followers to dance themselves as much as they are “danced by” their leader to be an equal voice in the creation of a dance.
            <br><br>
            Casey is an accomplished performer, spending years on Seattle’s Jackson Street Lindy Hoppers. She is a founding and active member of Sister Kate, an all female performance group, that regularly performs in Seattle.
            <br><br>
            Casey most regularly teaches with dancer extraordinaire and jazz guitarist, Michael “Falty” Faltesek. Together, they offer a unique approach imparts practical technical information without sacrificing creativity, musicality, and the excitement for swing dancing.
            <br><br>
            Casey’s competitive career notably includes first placements in the Camp Jitterbug Jack and Jill, Killer Diller Harvest Moon Lindy Competition, and ULHS Showcase Division. Today, Casey co-manages Savoy Swing Jam, Seattle’s lindy hop competition for one and all. Casey now regularly judges at some of the countries biggest events, including the International Lindy Hop Championships, Camp Hollywood, and Camp Jitterbug.
            <br><br>
            Casey’s philosophy is there is no wrong in the art of dance–there is only intent and effectiveness. If you aren’t expressing yourself as an individual, then you’re not doing yourself justice. As a teacher, her job is inspiring you to find your “dancing voice” and towards self-sufficiency in learning.
